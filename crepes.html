    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>
        Thin, delicate, and slightly chewy, crepes have a neutral 
        flavor that can be filled with both sweet or savory fillings. 
        Their texture is tender and smooth, and they soak up toppings like jam,
        Nutella, or lemon and sugar beautifully. Crepes are versatile and elegant, 
        offering a subtle, buttery flavor.

    <h2>Ingredients needed</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>1/2 cup milk</li>
        <li>1/2 cup water</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons butter, melted</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Whisk eggs, milk, water, and salt together in a large 
            mixing bowl; add flour and butter and whisk vigorously 
            until smooth.
        </li>
        <li>
            Heat a lightly oiled griddle or frying pan over medium-high
            heat. Pour or scoop the batter onto the pan, using 
            approximately 1/4 cup for each crêpe. Tilt the pan with
            a circular motion so that the batter coats the surface 
            evenly.
        </li>
        <li>
            Cook until the top of the crêpe is no longer wet and the 
            bottom has turned light brown, 1 to 2 minutes. Run a 
            spatula around the edge of the skillet to loosen the 
            crêpe; flip and cook until the other side has turned 
            light brown, about 1 minute more. Serve hot.
        </li>
    </ol>
